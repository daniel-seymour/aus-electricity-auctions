    "\t•\tAGL Energy: As of recent data, AGL operates Australia’s largest electricity generation portfolio within the National Electricity Market and is a leading private investor in renewable energy.  ￼\n",

    "\t•\tLoy Yang Power Station (Victoria): Located in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, Loy Yang consists of two sections: Loy Yang A and Loy Yang B. Combined, they form the largest power station in Australia by capacity.  ￼\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM), a Dispatchable Unit Identifier (DUID) is a unique identifier assigned by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to each dispatchable unit. A dispatchable unit refers to a specific generating unit within a power station, rather than the entire power station or the owning company. For example, Bayswater Power Station comprises four generating units, each with its own DUID (e.g., ‘BW01’ for Unit 1).  ￼\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each DUID corresponds to an individual generating unit within a power station, not to the power station as a whole or the company that owns it."
